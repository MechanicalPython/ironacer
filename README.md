# Ironacer
A project to deter squirrels from eating the garden acer by using darknet's yolo object detection and a bluetooth
controlled water hose. 

## General structure
Take a photo every second, analyse the photo to squirrels, detect the location of the squirrel, 
operate the anti-squirrel measure.


## Next Step
Create a bot that will use yolo to take photos of squirrels it sees and send it to the telegram chat.
