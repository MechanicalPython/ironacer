# Ironacer
A project to deter squirrels from eating the garden acer by using darknet's yolo object detection and a water hose

In the first version the anti-squirrel measure will be an area of effect hose that will be controlled by a solenoid 
water valve connected to the main water supply. This will allow for the use of a single camera and no targeting system

In version 2, there will be a stereoscopic camera for targeting a directed jet of water.
